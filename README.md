# Budget-Tracker

# User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information

# Reason
The purpose of this project was to give users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

 # Assignment
 For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.
 
 # Dependecies
 MongoDB, Express, Morgan, Compression, webpack-cli, webpackpwamanifest.Npm install these and do npm start and go to localhost3000.
 
 # Challenges
 
 The challenges that I have faced while doing this project was using IndexedDB and store it offline. And also getting it deployed to heroku. For some reason its building, but nothing is showing up on the application site.
